## Installation
Open a prompt command in your project folder root and run :
```bash
composer require khalyomede/laravel-api-generator
```
Next, go to `/config/app.php` and scroll down until reaching the `'providers' => [` array. Add the following line after the last provider :
```php
'provider' => [
  // Previous Services Providers ...  
  /**
   * Api Generator Command Line
   * 
   * Used on the console to create routes API from your database
   *
   * @example php artisan api:generate
   */
  Khalyomede\ApiGenerator\ApiGeneratorServiceProvider::class,
],
```
Now make sure the command line is available. Still on the prompt command, run :
```bash
php artisan list
```
You should see on the first commands this line :
```bash

 api
  api:generate         Generate models, controllers and API routes from a database.
```

## Limitations
- For now, if you try to run another time the command, this will not override previous routes but instead this will add again all the necessary routes. This has no impact in the final usage, but this can make the file `/routes/api.php` a little bit overwelmed if you run it several times.
- The code of each models is not as clear as it should be. An effort should be made to re-order the variables.

## Example of usage 1 : basic usage
```bash
php artisan api:generate
```
*Result :* this will create, for each tables in your database, a corresponding model, controller, and routes.

## How it works
Each time your run this command, at least 3 files are created :
- a model : located at `/app/<name>.php`, it represents the related table. It always begins with an uppercase.
- a controller : located at `/app/Http/Controllers/<name>Controller.php`, it is always the name of the model followed by "Controller"
- 5 routes : located at `/routes/api.php`, the programm will create 2 GET, 1 DELETE, 1 PUT and 1 POST route. They represents : displaying all the resources, displaying a specific resource, destroying a specific resource, updating a specific resource and creating a specific resource. 

## Why should I use it
The main advantage is to make an API quickly. The ultimate goal is to let you focus on things that have a value, like user interfaces and innovations, things that for the record cannot be automatized (at least not now !).
